# Paste Secure

## Overview

SecureContentSharing is a platform designed to facilitate secure sharing of sensitive content over the internet. Whether it's OTPs or confidential passwords, our platform provides a robust solution that prioritizes user privacy. The core functionality includes the option to share sensitive information that automatically vanishes on reload, provided the user has chosen the secure paste option. Additionally, all shared content comes with a set expiration time, ensuring data is automatically deleted from the database after a specified period.
